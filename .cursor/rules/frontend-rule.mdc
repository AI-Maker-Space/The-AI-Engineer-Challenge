### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc.
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel.
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally.
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

Use these colors in the theme:
```css
/* CSS HSL */
--wenge: hsla(346, 8%, 31%, 1);
--jasper: hsla(6, 65%, 57%, 1);
--persian-orange: hsla(23, 51%, 60%, 1);
--isabelline: hsla(50, 21%, 95%, 1);
--mint: hsla(161, 49%, 58%, 1);
```
