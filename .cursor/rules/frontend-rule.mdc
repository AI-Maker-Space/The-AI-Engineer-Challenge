### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc.
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel.
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally.
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

Use these colors in the theme:
```css
  --color-dustyrose-400: oklch(0.7526 0.0752 344.63);
  --color-olive-400: oklch(0.7068 0.1085 121.31);
```
