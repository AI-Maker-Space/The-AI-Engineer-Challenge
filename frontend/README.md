This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Next.js Frontend Setup

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Connecting to Backend

- The backend API is located in `api/app.py`.
- Update API URLs in your frontend code to point to your backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/your-endpoint`).

## Customization

- Edit files in the `src/` directory to customize your frontend.
- Add pages in `src/pages/` for new routes.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your backend is running and accessible from the frontend.
- If you change the backend port, update the API URLs accordingly.
